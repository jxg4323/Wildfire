[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

	[MAKE ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. USE 'BULLET POINT' OUTLINES.]

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]


============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?

[e.g. does it run right or crash, infinite loop when it should not, other?]

	[you will lose fewer points if 
	 you clearly describe the problems
	 and your work to solve those problems.]

	My projgram runs correclty and implements the wind direction and wind speed.


============= PROGRAM USAGE, OPTIONS AND Extra Credit ==

If you implemented extra credit or special, describe your results here.

[see the writeup for extra credit requirements if this applies to your work.]

	My results for the wind speed and direction were the greater the wind speed the 
	more likely it was that tree burned so as a result the genreations of trees decreased
	for all cases when wind was applied.

============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

I learned how to pass a struct pointer to functions and how to use memcpy to copy arrays.


What was easy about this assignment?

The assignment itself was fairly easy since it was an elaboration on hw3.


What gave you problems or troubles?

The only problem I had was using getopt such that it only took numerical arguments.
So instead I created a function to grab the numbers and implement the rules of the input.


What would you like the instructor to do to improve this assignment?

Potentially make the wind speed and wind direction a requirement.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

Dynamic allocation
